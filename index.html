    <p class="dialogue-text">Dialogue goes here: As he approached the clearing, he saw three figures standing before
      him. One was a tall, muscular man with piercing green eyes and a sly grin on his face. The second was a petite
      woman with long, flowing blonde hair and a kind expression. The third was a hooded figure, their face obscured by
      the shadows of their cloak.
